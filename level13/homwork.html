<h1>Python</h1>

  <p> <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> is a high-level, general-purpose <strong>programming</strong> language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[33]

    Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports <em>multiple</em> programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[34][35]
    
    Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[36] Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.[37]
    
     Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">programming languages</a>, and has gained widespread use in the machine learning community.</p>



         <p>History of Python</p>

           <p>Python was invented in the late 1980s[42] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[43] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[12] Its implementation began in December 1989.[44] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[45] (he's since come out of retirement and is self-titled "BDFL-emeritus"). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[46][47]</p>
